## Neighborhood Map

Instructions on how to use my Neighborhood Map Page.

Fork the repository

Then load the index.html into you chrome browser.

Since I live in Connecticut it starts you off in CT.  There is a google map with a star in the center of Ct.

I also show you the current temperature for CT

On the left hand side you will see FourSquare top picks for Connecitut and below the Map you will see New York Times articles about Connecticut.

If you click on one of the FourSquare suggestions you will see detail about it on the map.

You can change the City and State and you can also put in suggestions to narrow your FourSquare suggestions by typins something like, Pizza or
Stores or Bars or Resturant.

If you change the City/State to say California the FourSquare suggestions and Temperature and the New York Times articles will change to California.

2.  Took the JavaScript Design Patterns 
3.  Watched a office hours that discussed P5.
4.  Talk to people at ATT where I work, for help.  Lots of very smart people there that can assist you when you come into a roadblock which I did many times.
